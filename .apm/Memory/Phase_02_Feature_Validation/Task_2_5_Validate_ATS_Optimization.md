# Task Log: Task 2.5 - Validate ATS Optimization

## Summary
Validated ATS optimization instructions in master prompt. Prompt includes keyword extraction and natural integration guidelines.

## Details
- ATS optimization section in MASTER_PROMPT_TEMPLATE:
  - "Extract key terms from job description"
  - "Integrate them naturally into resume (don't stuff)"
  - "Match their exact terminology when possible"
  - "Prioritize Experience section, then Skills, then Summary"
- XYZ bullet format improves ATS parsing (structured format)

## Output
- Validated: MASTER_PROMPT_TEMPLATE ATS section
- Tailored resume output prioritizes keyword integration

- Consider adding ATS checker integration in future
