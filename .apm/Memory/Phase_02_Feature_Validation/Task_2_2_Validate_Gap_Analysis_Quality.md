# Task Log: Task 2.2 - Validate Gap Analysis Quality

## Summary
Validated gap analysis structure in master prompt. Schema includes actionable fields: what_you_have, what_you_lack, and bridge_the_gap with tiered action plans.

## Details
- `what_you_have`: 4-6 specific matching qualifications
- `what_you_lack`: 3-5 honest gaps with specificity
- `bridge_the_gap`: Structured action plans with:
  - `quick_win`: This week actions
  - `medium_term`: 2-4 week actions
  - `portfolio_project`: Optional project idea
  - `resources`: Name, URL, time, cost

## Output
- Validated: RESPONSE_SCHEMA gap analysis fields
- Example output demonstrates expected specificity level

## Issues
- Live API testing blocked by rate limits
- Full validation during Phase 4 with real data

## Next Steps
- Continue to Phase 3 Frontend
