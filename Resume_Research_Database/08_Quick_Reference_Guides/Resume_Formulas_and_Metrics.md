## 📐 SPACING & LAYOUT FORMULAS

### **Master Spacing Formula**
```
S = B × M × H

S = Optimal spacing (in points)
B = Base unit (font size in points)
M = Multiplier (relationship constant)
H = Hierarchy level (1-6)

Multipliers:
Within-element: M = 0.3
Between-element: M = 0.5
Section spacing: M = 1.3
Major spacing: M = 2.1
```

**Example (11pt font):**
```
Between bullets: 11 × 0.3 = 3.3pt → 3pt
Between jobs: 11 × 0.5 = 5.5pt → 5pt
Between sections: 11 × 1.3 = 14.3pt → 14pt
After header: 11 × 2.1 = 23.1pt → 23pt
```

---

### **Vertical Rhythm Formula**
```
V = n × L

V = Vertical spacing
n = Integer multiplier (1, 2, 3, etc.)
L = Line height (leading)

All spacing = multiples of baseline
```

---

### **Content-to-Space Ratio (CSR)**
```
CSR = (Text Area) / (White Space Area)

Optimal: 1.2:1 to 1.6:1

Content: 52-60% of usable area
White Space: 40-48% of usable area

Warning Zones:
CSR > 2.5:1 → Too dense
CSR < 0.8:1 → Too sparse
```

---

### **Information Density Score**
```
ID = (W × I) / A

ID = Information Density Score
W = Word count
I = Impact factor (weighted by importance)
A = Area in square inches

Optimal ID Score: 25-35 per square inch
Total Resume Words: 400-800 words
```

---

### **Eye-Path Saccade Distance**
```
SD = √[(x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)²]

Total Saccade Distance (TSD):
TSD = Σ(SD₁ + SD₂ + ... + SDₙ)

Goal: Minimize TSD through proper alignment
```

---

### **Cognitive Load Score (CLS)**
```
CLS = (E × D) / (W + S)

E = Number of distinct elements
D = Information density (chars per sq in)
W = White space percentage (0-100)
S = Structural clarity score (0-10)

Target CLS: 2.5 - 4.0
```

---

### **Character Per Line (CPL)**
```
CPL = (Page Width - Margins) × Characters per inch

For 11pt Calibri:
Characters per inch: ~12
Usable width: 7 inches (8.5" - 1.5" margins)
CPL = 7 × 12 = 84 characters

Optimal: 50-75 CPL
```

---

### **Golden Ratio Application**
```
φ = 1.618

Optimal margin ratios:
If page height = 11 inches
Top margin: 11 ÷ 1.618 = 0.68 inches
Bottom margin: 1.1 inches (1.618 × top margin)

Content sections:
Top Section: ~38% of page (1/φ)
Middle Section: ~38% of page
Bottom Section: ~24% of page
```

---

## 🔤 TYPOGRAPHY FORMULAS

### **Line Height (Leading) Formula**
```
Leading = Font size × 1.2 to 1.5

10pt font → 12-15pt leading
11pt font → 13-16pt leading
12pt font → 14-18pt leading

Optimal: 1.15-1.3 multiplier
```

---

### **Visual Angle Formula**
```
α = 2 arctan(h/2d)

α = visual angle
h = height of object (letter)
d = viewing distance

Optimal reading angle: 0.3° to 0.5°
Typical viewing distance: 20-24 inches
```

---

### **Contrast Ratio Formula**
```
CR = (L1 + 0.05) / (L2 + 0.05)

L1 = Relative luminance of lighter color
L2 = Relative luminance of darker color

Minimum: 4.5:1 (WCAG AA)
Optimal: 7:1 or higher (WCAG AAA)
Black on White: 21:1 (ideal)
```

---

### **Modular Typography Scale**
```
Base × 1.25ⁿ = Header size

1.25 Scale (Major Third):
Name/Header: 20pt (base × 1.25³)
Section Headers: 14pt (base × 1.25²)
Job Titles: 11-12pt (base × 1.25)
Body Text: 10-11pt (base)
Metadata: 9-10pt (base ÷ 1.25)
```

---

## 🎯 CONTENT FORMULAS

### **Shannon's Information Entropy**
```
H(X) = -Σ P(xi) log₂ P(xi)

Low entropy = organized, easy to process
High entropy = chaotic, hard to parse

Goal: Minimize entropy through structure
```

---

### **Miller's Law Application**
```
Working Memory Capacity: 7±2 chunks

Optimal sections: 5-7
Optimal bullets per job: 4-6 (current), 3-4 (previous)
Max bullets: Never >7 per job
```

---

### **PAR-Q Bullet Formula**

Score = Impact × Quantification × Clarity
Target Score: >75
```

## 🔑 KEYWORD & ATS FORMULAS

### **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**
```
TF-IDF = TF(t) × IDF(t)

TF(t) = (Number of times term t appears) / (Total terms)
IDF(t) = log(Total resumes / Resumes containing term t)

Keyword Density Sweet Spot: 1.5-3% of total words
Optimal mentions per keyword: 2-3 times
```

---

### **Keyword Match Score**
```
Match % = (Matching Keywords / Total Job Description Keywords) × 100

Q = Quantification Score (0-100)
F = Format Score (0-100)
K = Keyword Score (0-100)
C = Clarity Score (0-100)
T = Tailoring Score (0-100)
D = Design Score (0-100)

Target: RQS > 75 (competitive), RQS > 85 (excellent)
```

---

### **Perfect Resume Layout (PRL) Score**
```
PRL = (VH × AR × CS × ID) / (CL × ER)

VH = Visual Hierarchy (0-10)
AR = Alignment Rigor (0-10)
CS = Content-Space balance (0-10)
ID = Information Density optimization (0-10)
