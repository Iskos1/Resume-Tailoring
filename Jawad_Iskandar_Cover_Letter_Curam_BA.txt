Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Curam Business Analyst position. As a recent B.S. Business Administration graduate (December 2025, 3.78 GPA) with three years of business analysis experience serving 50+ clients, I bring proven expertise in requirements gathering, gap analysis, data modeling, and stakeholder management.

During my three years at Apple, I served as the primary liaison between business users and technical teams, translating operational needs into technical specifications for enterprise systems including Salesforce CRM and MDM platforms. I conducted gap analyses through client workshops that resulted in 18% ROI increases and 30% workflow efficiency improvements. This experience has equipped me with the critical ability to elicit and validate business requirements, document functional specifications, and ensure alignment between business objectives and technical implementations.

My technical foundation aligns strongly with your requirements. I am proficient in SQL, Python, R, Power BI, and Tableau, with hands-on experience in database querying, data modeling, and linked data analysis. My academic projects include building data pipelines processing 3,000+ counties and developing predictive models achieving 86% AUC performance. My coursework in Systems Analysis & Design, Data Mining, and Information Systems Audit provides the framework for systematic business analysis and requirements documentation.

While I have not worked directly with Curam software, my experience implementing enterprise systems at Apple demonstrates my ability to quickly learn complex platforms and translate business needs into system configurations. I am eager to invest in Curam training and certification to become a valuable contributor to your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background can contribute to your organization's success. I am available at (571) 269-8465 or Jawad.iskandar@outlook.com.

Sincerely,

Sincerely,

Jawad Iskandar
