# Resume Tailoring Application

An AI-powered resume builder that uses OpenAI to automatically tailor your resume to specific job descriptions.

## Features

- 📝 **Resume Editor**: Comprehensive form to edit all sections of your resume
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Tailoring**: Uses OpenAI GPT-4 to optimize your resume for specific job postings
- 📄 **PDF Export**: Download your tailored resume as a PDF
- 💾 **Auto-Save**: Your resume data is automatically saved locally

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure OpenAI API Key

You need an OpenAI API key to use the AI tailoring feature.

**Option A: Using .env file (Recommended)**

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key-here
   ```

**Option B: Directly in server.js**

The API key is already configured in `server.js` as a fallback. However, for security reasons, it's better to use a `.env` file.

### 3. Start the Server

```bash
npm start
```

The application will start on `http://localhost:5001`
